                        <h2>Ms. America Pageant</h2>
                        <p>“I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become
                            an
                            actress, get a role on All My Children, meet my husband on set– and when that was all over,
                            I’d
                            host a talk show. Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. Back then it seemed like every woman
                            on
                            television had gotten their start as beauty queen. So my senior year I decided to enter my
                            school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms. America pageant. But this
                            was
                            a rough high school, only one other girl signed up, so I had a good shot. My whole family
                            got
                            behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner
                            wore
                            a white dress. So she sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First
                            came
                            the interview portion, and that’s when the trouble started. The judges asked me about the
                            Anita
                            Hill testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I was ready for world peace. </p>
                        <p>They were supposed to ask
                            me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent portion
                            was
                            later that night at the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena
                            Easton
                            song; poor choice. Not the right crowd for that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by
                            Stephanie
                            Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing along. That’s when I knew it was over. But then,
                            a
                            miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and announced the winner: it was me.
                            Me!
                            It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me. But
                            it
                            only lasted five seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry.
                            Joanna
                            is the runner-up.’ It was the worst moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me
                            through COVID was knowing that it could not possibly, possibly be worse than that moment.
                            And
                            here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several years later I ended up
                            acting
                            alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and the
                            director was like: ‘We need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was
                            like:
                            ‘Well, that’s easy. His father ruined my senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.”
